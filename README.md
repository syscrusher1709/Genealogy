# Genealogy
Re-implementing and extending a genealogy application I made for a local library

Many years ago, I created a database for the local public library where my wife worked.
The staff wanted to make the small town's newspaper obituary archives available online
and were willing to hand-enter over 50 thousand records in their "copious spare time"
to make that possible.

The original database was in MySQL, with a web interface using Drupal. This new project
aims to reverse-engineer my own code using Python and various modern support libraries
to make something that is easily deployed and maintained by small organizations. The
old application, which was called simply "Obituary", had no other function than what its
name suggested, but in this new version I'd like to add other features as time permits.

This is a spare-time project, so aside from the standard disclaimers in the LICENSE file,
please know that this is a work-in-progress with no fixed schedule for delivery.

Once there is a working vertical slice with the same functionality as the old one, I
should be able to provide a link to a working web site with real (public domain) data.
